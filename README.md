# OneWeek 2020: Crew 512 + Crew Cosmonauts

> The goal of this project is to demonstrate different capabilities using Istio Service Mesh.


## Team 1
- Traffic Patterns using ISTIO and different version of Helium
    - Blue Green
    - Canary
    - Circuit Breaker (Disaster Recovery/HA modes active-active or active standby)
    - Use Kiali to show and test traffic flow for all three patterns
- Members:

### Overview: TBD


## Team 2
- Scaling out the application under heavy load
    - Expand current cluster by adding new nodes
    - Use a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) resource to scale pods in same cluster
    - Burst traffic into another cluster
    - *Bonus: Look into scaling Cosmos DB when the load is high as well*
