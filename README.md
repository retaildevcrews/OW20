# OneWeek 2020: Crew 512 + Crew Cosmonauts

> The goal of this project is to collaborate as a team and be able to integrate and demonstrate some of the different capabilities that Kubernetes + Istio Service Mesh offer.

## Team 1: Traffic Patterns using ISTIO and different version of Helium

- Blue Green Pattern
- Canary Pattern
- Circuit Breaker (Disaster Recovery/HA modes active-active or active standby)
- Use Kiali to show and test traffic flow for all three patterns

### Members:

## Team 2: Scaling out the application under heavy load

- Use a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) resource to scale pods in same cluster
- Auto-scale current cluster by adding new nodes
- *Bonus: Scaling Cosmos DB when the load is high*
